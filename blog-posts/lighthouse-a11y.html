        <p>
          Making websites accessible isn’t just about compliance, it’s about
          creating inclusive experiences for everyone. A powerful and simple way
          to get started is by using <strong>Lighthouse</strong>, a free
          auditing tool built right into Chrome. In this article, I’ll show you
          exactly how to use Lighthouse in DevTools to generate an accessibility
          report, and encourage you to run it on this very site!
        </p>

        <h2>What is Lighthouse?</h2>
        <p>
          Lighthouse is an open-source tool developed by Google that analyzes
          web pages and provides performance, SEO, best practices, and, most
          importantly, accessibility scores. It gives you a clear, actionable
          breakdown of how your site performs and what can be improved.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Open Lighthouse in DevTools</h2>
        <p>To run Lighthouse from Chrome:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open the website you want to audit, try it on this site if you’d
            like!
          </li>
          <li>
            Right-click anywhere on the page and select
            <strong>Inspect</strong> to open Chrome DevTools. You can also press
            <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> (or <code>Cmd+Option+I</code> on Mac).
          </li>
          <li>
            In DevTools, find the <strong>Lighthouse</strong> tab. If you don’t
            see it, click the double arrow (<code>»</code>) at the top to expand
            more tabs.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Setting Up the Audit</h2>
        <p>Once you’re in the Lighthouse tab:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Under <strong>Categories</strong>, make sure only
            <strong>Accessibility</strong> is checked.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose the device type: <strong>Mobile</strong> or
            <strong>Desktop</strong>. Desktop is fine for now.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the blue <strong>Analyze page load</strong> button to start
            the audit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img
          class="blog-post-image"
          src="../assets/images/lighthouse-a11y-picture.png"
          alt="Lighthouse report trigger"
        />

        <p>
          Chrome will reload the page, run the audit, and display a detailed
          report within a few seconds.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the Report</h2>
        <p>
          At the top of your report, you’ll see an
          <strong>Accessibility score</strong> from 0 to 100. Below that,
          Lighthouse lists specific issues found on the page. Some common items
          might include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Images without descriptive <code>alt</code> text</li>
          <li>Low contrast between text and background</li>
          <li>Buttons or links missing accessible names</li>
          <li>Elements not reachable by keyboard navigation</li>
        </ul>

        <img
          class="blog-post-image"
          src="../assets/images/lighthouse-a11y-picture-2.png"
          alt="Lighthouse result"
        />

        <p>
          Each issue comes with an explanation and suggestions on how to fix it,
          including links to documentation for deeper learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
        <p>
          Open DevTools right now and run a Lighthouse audit on this page. See
          how it performs! Then, try it on a few other sites you visit
          regularly. You’ll be surprised how many small issues can add up, and
          how easy they are to start fixing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Accessibility doesn’t have to be intimidating. With tools like
          Lighthouse, it’s easy to identify opportunities for improvement and
          build more inclusive websites, one audit at a time.
