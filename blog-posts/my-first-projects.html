          Looking back at my time in university, two projects stand out as the
          cornerstones of my journey into web development. They weren’t just
          assignments, they were the first real opportunities where theory met
          practice, where I discovered how much I enjoyed building interactive,
          responsive, and user-focused applications. These projects also
          introduced me to technologies and practices that continue to influence
          how I work today.
        </p>

          <h2>1. Residential Building Management Web Application</h2>
          <p>
            The first major milestone came during my bachelor’s degree: a web
            application designed to manage a residential building. At first
            glance, it sounded simple, but the challenge was to make it
            <strong>scalable, secure, and cloud-based</strong>. This meant I
            couldn’t just build a static site and call it a day. I had to learn
            how to design for flexibility and future growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project’s backbone was the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, MongoDB
            for the database, Express.js for server-side routing, React.js for
            the user interface, and Node.js for backend logic. Choosing React
            for the frontend was a turning point for me. It was the first time I
            experienced the power of a component-based architecture, where
            reusable UI elements made the application more maintainable and
            dynamic.
          </p>
          <div>
            On the cloud side, I dove deep into
            <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>EC2</strong> for hosting the application server</li>
              <li>
                <strong>S3</strong> for storing user-uploaded documents securely
              </li>
              <li><strong>Route 53</strong> for DNS management</li>
              <li><strong>SES</strong> for email notifications</li>
              <li><strong>IAM</strong> for secure role-based access control</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            The application offered features like a secure login system, a
            dashboard for both residents and administrators, a forum for
            community discussions, a document section for building policies, and
            a booking system for shared facilities. All of this was tied
            together by an authentication flow that ensured different access
            levels for admins and users.
          </p>

          <h2>2. An AI-Enhanced E-Commerce Web App</h2>
          <p>
            Fast forward to my master’s degree, and I was ready for a bigger
            challenge: combining modern web development with artificial
            intelligence. This project aimed to create a full-fledged
            <strong>E-Commerce web application</strong> and enhance it with
            open-source AI services to improve user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like my first project, the frontend was built with
            <strong>React.js</strong>, but this time my component architecture
            and state management skills had matured. The backend ran on
            <strong>Node.js</strong>, with an API structure that could easily
            integrate with various AI services.
          </p>
          <div>
            The AI features were the heart of the project:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Speech recognition</strong> (Speech-to-Text) so users
                could search for products or build their shopping carts using
                voice commands
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Image-based search</strong> to find similar products by
                uploading photos
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Personalized product recommendations</strong> using user
                browsing history and preference patterns
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            All of this was done with a
            <strong>mobile-first design</strong> mindset, ensuring the
            application felt natural and fluid on smartphones, a must for
            today’s online shoppers. The combination of frontend polish, backend
            integration, and AI experimentation made this project one of the
            most exciting I’ve ever worked on.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time I completed this project, I had not only deepened my
            understanding of React and full-stack workflows, but I had also
            gained firsthand experience in working with
            <strong>AI-powered tools</strong>, something that has only grown
            more relevant in web development.

          <h2>Looking Back</h2>
          <p>
            Together, these two projects formed the foundation of my technical
            skill set. The first taught me the value of cloud infrastructure and
            building scalable apps. The second pushed me into the future with AI
            integrations and mobile-first design.
          </p>
          <p>
            These two projects were the perfect example of learning while doing,
            and my passion for development started with the joy of seeing them
            achieving their purposes.
